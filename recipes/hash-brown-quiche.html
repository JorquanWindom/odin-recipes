            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place hash browns in a medium bowl. Melt 5 tablespoons butter and pour over hash browns, season with seasoning salt or garlic powder as desired. Add 1 egg, mix well and press mixture onto the bottom and sides of a 9-inch spring form pan or pie dish.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven until potatoes are golden brown and crispy around the edges, about 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>While crust bakes, melt remaining tablespoon of butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, pepper, and green onion; cook and stir until bell pepper slightly softens, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>When crust is ready, spread ham mixture over the bottom; sprinkle cheese evenly on top. Whisk remaining 5 eggs and cream in a medium bowl; add salt and pepper to taste and mix until well blended. Pour mixture evenly over ham and cheese mixture.</li>
                <li>Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.) Bake in the preheated oven until filling is puffed and quiche is lightly browned around the edges, about 35 minutes.</li>
